Dictionary App by Kenneth Eze

To run the code simply go to the directory ./dictionary in the terminal and type 'python database.py' then 'python dictionary.py' to run the program.

Or just open the folder in any IDE and run the database.py to create the database, then run dictionary.py to use the application.

Enjoy.
